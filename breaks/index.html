        With any luck, your bug will have been caught through this process! But if not, don't worry about it, and don't forget to take breaks! When you're stuck in a certain mindset or frame of thinking, it can be hard to identify root assumptions that might be causing your error. A wonderful way to reset your brain is to simply take a break and drink some water, or maybe just come back to the problem another day. I also recommend going to pet a cat, or doing some physical activity. Approaching these issues with a fresh mind is so helpful to seeing what you previously missed, which is really what debugging is all about.
